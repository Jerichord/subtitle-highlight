Chrome extension for highlighting text on Youtube.

## Usage

Download the app from the chrome webstore (once available), and once the extension is enabled, 
the subtitles should show up on any Youtube video. Click the extension icon to 
see the controls for resizing, dragging, and choosing a language.
* Select language from drop down.
* Drag using icon next to language drop down.
* Resize text using bottom right like a browser window.
* Increase width using right side like a browser window.

## About the Project

This project came out of a need to develop something to get out of a rut, before tackling
other projects. I also needed a tool to select youtube subtitles for myself. At the time of making it, I tried 
finding an extension that allowed selecting text, and since the first few results did not have it,
I thought that it would be nice to develop to see what goes on in extensions and subtitles.

## Main inspirations
multi-subs-yt - https://github.com/garywill/multi-subs-yt
Dual subtitles - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-dual-subtitles/hkbdddpiemdeibjoknnofflfgbgnebcm

## Issues
At the time of posting, there are these, but I will move on to different projects now:
* Not working if starting off on auto-translate/ if there is only auto translate
* Captions not appearing until refresh of browser and turning subtitle on and off.
* Resizing from larger to smaller is not smooth.
* Not planning on expanding to multi-subs, so subtitle box and matches are "hard-coded"\
to only 2. Logic could be refactored to support multi, but I did not.
* Vertical resizing would increase logic, so I held of on responsiveness.
